<h1>Assignment 1: Obstruction</h1>
The goal of this assignment was to create a game called "Obstruction" in Python3 - a paper-pencil game for two players (check it out here: http://www.papg.com/show?2XMX) </br>
The game consists of a two-dimensional board, where one player is "X" and the other is "O". The players take turns to write their checker in a free cell and then surrounding cells are blocked (meaning they cannot house a checker later on). The first player who is unable to find a free cell loses.
